**Author**: Lauren Sierra
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
As a user of City Explorer, I want to enter the name of a location so that I can see data about the area of interest to me.
As a user, I want to request current weather information so that I can learn more about the typical weather patterns in the location I had entered.

## Getting Started

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
